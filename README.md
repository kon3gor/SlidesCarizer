# SlidesCatizer

One day, I discovered that I add lots of cats to my presentations. And it's really hard to place them in the right place. 
So I decided to create an api that could do it randomly so that I colud focus on the informative content of the presentation

## How to use this
Well, due to I wasn't able to get the Google serification, I had to trick it someway.<br>
_( it was some kind of introduction )_

#### So that is the instruction

1. You need to create a new presentation in Google Slides.
2. Create your presentation.
3. Share access to your presentation to eshendo.projects@gmail.com.
4. Copy link to your presentation.
5. Paste it into input filed on the [Slides Catizer website](http://catizer-site.herokuapp.com/)
6. Press **Catize** button.
7. Return to your presentation and enjoy the result.
8. Try to offset the cats a bit so to fit them to the presentation.

That's all, now you know how to use my website.<br>
## TODO
 * Add the Slides Hedgehogizer.
 * Change the markup.
 * Try to get the Google sertification.
